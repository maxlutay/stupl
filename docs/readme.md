 docs need rework !!!


 current design topics and questions(not in order):

- do functions arguments need specific notation? why? which ? is '@' ok for this? or '#' ? or '_' ?
- do functions need 'return' statement? for which purposes?
- do functions need named return variable, optional or mandatory ?
- do functions need "spread/rest operator" argument expansion? Syntax of specifing types for such operator? do such operator need possibility of specifing count of arguments? what about templating such operator? what language mechanism would be used?
- do functions need multiple argument expansion option? how to distinguish between multiple expansion operators?
- how to make pointer/reference/value copy/move passing more convenient?
- syntax for class memory management? how to specify allocation functions? are stack memory needed at all? syntax for class construction on heap and stack ?
- syntax for type information of variable? dot notation inherited from common parent object? 
- syntax for private/public class memebers? maybe use templates annotations? what about groups of variables? grouping templates? public interfaces? i do not like to add special syntax like in c++, c#, java etc.
- syntax for templates? %//%? #[]? #[]#? @{}? 
- syntax for multithreading and atomics? templates again? multithreaded memory management syntax?
- syntax for 1 line comment? only ';'? what about '//' and '#'? 
- do we need multiline comment? syntax for multiline comment using ';'? or use '/**/'? what about nested comments?
- do syntax for interfaces needed? 
- do class inheritance need public/protected/private specifiers?
- do templates need inheritance hierarchy? like '<| classname'? 
- ?todo
